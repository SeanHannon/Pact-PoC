# Pact-PoC
Pact proof of concept using Spring Boot

To use this PoC you will first need to run the tests of  pact-consumer-spring using

> ./mvnw clean verify

After this has been run you will need to copy the pact file found in build/pacts to the pacts folder in the pact-provider-spring at the directory /src/test/resources/pacts

Once this has been done you can run the tests for the provider and it will check against the pact file generated by the consumer.
Tests can be fun as follows

> ./mvnw clean verify
